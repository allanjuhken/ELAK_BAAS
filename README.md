# ELAK_BAAS is java command line interface program powered by Hibernate. It's an administration system designed 
for a skydiving club, where you can add club members personal data to the 
database, register and save loads that are done during jumpdays.
Program uses MySQL database with 4 tables:
    1. AIRCRAFT - information about planes that are used
    2. JUMPER - information about skydivers
    3. JUMPER_JUMPS - saves information about skydives that jumper has done
    4. MANIFEST - the table where loads for planes are put together
    
At this stage, all methods in main class works, but program needs a lot of improvement to 
serve it's goal(updates goming soon :)
